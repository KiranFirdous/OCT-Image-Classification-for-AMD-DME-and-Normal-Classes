# OCT-Image-Classification-for-AMD-DME-and-Normal-Classes
This project implements a transfer learning-based approach for classifying Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into three categories: - **AMD** (Age-related Macular Degeneration) - **DME** (Diabetic Macular Edema) - **NORMAL** (Normal retina)
