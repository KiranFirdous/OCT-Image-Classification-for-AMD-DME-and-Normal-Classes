# OCT Image Classification for AMD, DME, and Normal Classes

This project implements a transfer learning-based approach for classifying Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images into three categories:
- **AMD** (Age-related Macular Degeneration)
- **DME** (Diabetic Macular Edema)
- **NORMAL** (Normal retina)

## Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3)
- **Data Augmentation**: Improves model generalization with image transformations
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Provides detailed metrics and visualizations
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and modify

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oct-classification.git
cd oct-classification
